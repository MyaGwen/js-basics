    1. Open the google chrome browser or any browser of your choice.
    2. Right-click anywhere in the browser window and select Inspect from the pop-up menu.

6.  Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category.
    - Statically typed programming languages require the programmer to declare the data types of variables before they can be used in the program. The compiler checks that the data types match before the program runs, and errors are caught during the compilation process. Examples of statically typed languages include Java, C++, C#, and Go.

    - Dynamically typed programming languages, on the other hand, do not require the programmer to declare the data types of variables, and the type is determined at runtime. The interpreter checks for compatibility between the data types when the program is executed, and errors are caught during runtime. Examples of dynamically typed languages include JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and PHP.

7. Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined’.
   - Null in JavaScript is a value that represents intentionally having no value, while Undefined is a value that represents having no value because it has not been assigned a value.
